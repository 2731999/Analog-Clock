# Building Analog-Clock from scratch

### This is a simple analog clock project built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays the current time and updates every second.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## Summary
I build the analog clock as it is used in many big projects such as phone widgets, Screan saver and on window from where the user can set a classic view on his or her system.


## How to Use

To use the analog clock, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. The clock should start displaying the current time immediately.

## Credits

This project was inspired by my mobile widgets where I can place a good looking analog clock on my wallpaper.
